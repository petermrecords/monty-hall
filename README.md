# monty-hall

A demonstration of the answer to the Monty Hall problem in Python 3.5

## The Monty Hall Problem as described by Wikipedia:

"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors.  Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats.  You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat.  He then says to you, 'Do you want to pick door No. 2?'

Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?"

Counterintuitively the answer is yes -- switching doors will raise your chances of winning from 1 in 3 to 2 in 3.

This program allows users to run the scenario (with a random placement of the car, and first choice) any number of times and returns the number of times the user wins the car.  It can be run from the command line.
